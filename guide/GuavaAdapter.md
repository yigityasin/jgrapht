title: Guava Graph Adapter
---

# {{ page.title }}

If you are using [Guava's common.graph data structure](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/GraphsExplained), and would like to take advantage of an algorithm implemented by JGraphT, it's quite straightforward to do this via the adapters supplied by JGraphT.

For example, suppose you've created a Guava graph as follows:

```java
        MutableGraph<String> guava = GraphBuilder.undirected().build();
        guava.addNode("ul");
        guava.addNode("um");
        guava.addNode("ur");
        guava.addNode("ml");
        guava.addNode("mm");
        guava.addNode("mr");
        guava.addNode("ll");
        guava.addNode("lm");
        guava.addNode("lr");
        guava.putEdge("ul", "um");
        guava.putEdge("um", "ur");
        guava.putEdge("ml", "mm");
        guava.putEdge("mm", "mr");
        guava.putEdge("ll", "lm");
        guava.putEdge("lm", "lr");
        guava.putEdge("ul", "ml");
        guava.putEdge("ml", "ll");
        guava.putEdge("um", "mm");
        guava.putEdge("mm", "lm");
        guava.putEdge("ur", "mr");
        guava.putEdge("mr", "lr");
```

The graph does not have any information associated with the edges, so we can use JGraphT's [MutableGraphAdapter](https://jgrapht.org/javadoc/org/jgrapht/graph/guava/MutableGraphAdapter.html) to view it in JGraphT:

```java
        Graph<String, EndpointPair<String>> jgrapht = new MutableGraphAdapter<>(guava);
```

Now suppose we want to find a [minimum vertex cover](https://brilliant.org/wiki/vertex-cover) for this graph.  JGraphT supplies [several algorithms](https://jgrapht.org/javadoc/org/jgrapht/alg/vertexcover/package-summary.html) for this purpose:

```java
        VertexCoverAlgorithm<String> alg = new RecursiveExactVCImpl<>(jgrapht);
        VertexCoverAlgorithm.VertexCover<String> cover = alg.getVertexCover();
        Set<String> expectedCover = new HashSet<String>(Arrays.asList("um", "ml", "mr", "lm"));
        assertEquals(expectedCover, cover);
```

Since the result is just a set of strings, it can be used to directly reference the JGraphT view as well as the underlying Guava graph.

For more information on the available adapters, please see the [org.jgrapht.graph.guava javadoc](https://jgrapht.org/javadoc/org/jgrapht/graph/guava/package-summary.html).
